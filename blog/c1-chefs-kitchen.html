            Hey everyone, I didn't watch even half the video but I think I get what he's portraying, and its 1030pm on sunday so I think I should smash something out. I have actually worked in Hospitality full time since I left high school, so really like his comparison between kitchen and restaurant thinking. I have always been type that likes putting in whatever effort it takes to get something done. I am really stoked about being part of this team of keen people on this rollercoaster journey of growing into a confident beginner software developer.

            I know this course will be the most challenging thing I have ever done, at I reckon together we can get there! I have looked at studying different things in the past but nothing stood out like this course.
            After learning about the Dev bootcamp years ago I said yea that sounds cool but didn't take up a trip to the US for a course i knew nothing about really. Everyone that knows about the course including friends at Uni said that sounds like a great thing for me! I have always felt like Hospo management was a starting point for something better. I Loved most aspects of hopso apart from the fact after a hard nights work there's not a huge return on my efforts.. Just a big cash up and clean up ready to repeat it again tomorrow, and maybe half the people will be appreciative of my efforts. Bring it on! sorry for rambling on i think i should move on and submit this weeks work soon!!
