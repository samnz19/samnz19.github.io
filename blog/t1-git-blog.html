            What are the benefits of version control?

            So version control software is locally stored on your computer and it has some great benefits to take advantage of, E.g. there was one point when i was re-formatting all of my reflections because they looked a bit weird, and I tried to push them all to my Github repo at once. But for some reason i managed to replace all my blogs with the "1-think-about-time" one which was my first reflection. So when i looked on Github the four reflection files were all replaced with "1-think-about-time." At that point i stressed and said a bad work quite loud!! But soon realized i still had all of the original files in Sublime. Phew! That to me saved my day and probably some precious time. I could then easily add, commit, and push them back to my repo sucessfully. I know they werent amazing but i put effort in to them! I was so relieved after that and there's the beauty of Git.

            How does git help you keep track of changes?

            Git helps you keep track of your changes by enabling you to push your files online when you need but also keeps copies of the file locally so you can go "back in time" if you like.

            Why use GitHub to store your code?

            Using Github is a great way to store you code because other people can access it, modify it, and basically work with you to improve it, even if they're somewhere else entirely! Its live online and updated whenever you want it to be.
